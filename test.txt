Hi Priya,

I wanted to follow up on our discussion about the product launch schedule. From an operations standpoint, the team can meet the April 30 target if we freeze features by the end of next week.

That said, I spoke with Legal earlier this week about the data-collection feature. They advised that rolling it out without updating the privacy disclosures could expose us to regulatory penalties, especially in the EU. Based on that guidance, we may need to delay the launch or limit the feature set for the initial release.

Let me know if we should plan for a phased rollout instead, and I’ll update the engineering leads accordingly.

Thanks,
Alex
