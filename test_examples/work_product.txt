Hi boss,

Attached (below) are the draft questions I've prepared for the expert witness deposition next Tuesday. I've focused on poking holes in their methodology regarding the valuation.

1. "Can you explain the specific variance formula used in your report?"
2. "Did you account for the market downturn in Q3?"
3. "Is it true that your prior testimony in Case X contradicts your current conclusion?"

Please review and let me know if I should add more pressure on the credential verification.

Thanks,
Junior
