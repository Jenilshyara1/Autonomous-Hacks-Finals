Dear CEO,

Regarding the ongoing dispute with Vendor X, my legal assessment is that the cost of continued litigation outweighs the potential damages. Juries in this jurisdiction tend to favor local plaintiffs.

I recommend authorizing a settlement offer up to $50,000. If we go to trial, our exposure could be upwards of $200,000 plus fees.

Do not share this assessment with the vendor or anyone outside the core executive team.

Regards,
Counsel
