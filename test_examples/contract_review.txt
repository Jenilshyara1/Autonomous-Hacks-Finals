Hi CTO,

I've reviewed the Master Services Agreement from AWS. I have significant concerns about the limitation of liability clause (Section 9). It currently caps their liability at 6 months of fees, which is insufficient given the sensitive data we are storing.

I have redlined the document to request a cap of 3x annual fees or $1M, whichever is higher. 

Please do not sign the current version.

Thanks,
Legal
