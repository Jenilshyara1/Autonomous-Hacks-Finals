Subject: CONFIDENTIAL: Strategy for Smith v. Jones Litigation

Sarah,

I have reviewed the complaint filed by Jones. Based on our initial analysis of the contract clauses, I believe we have a strong defense regarding the Force Majeure claim. However, the indemnity provision is riskier.

I advise that we do not admit to any liability in upcoming internal memos. We should prepare a motion to dismiss based on the jurisdiction argument we discussed. 

Please keep this communication confidential as it contains legal advice and strategy.

Best,
Alex
