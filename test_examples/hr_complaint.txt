CONFIDENTIAL

I received a formal complaint today from Jane Doe regarding... [redacted sensitive details] ...alleging a hostile work environment.

We need to launch an internal investigation immediately. I need your legal guidance on how to structure the interview process to ensure we are protected against potential future litigation.

Please advise on the next steps.
