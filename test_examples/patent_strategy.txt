I've analyzed the prior art search results for the new battery technology. While there is some overlap with Patent US-999888, I believe your specific electrolyte formulation is novel enough to patent.

However, to avoid alerting competitors, I advise we file a provisional patent application immediately but delay the non-provisional filing until the product launch date is finalized.

This advice is based on maximizing our IP protection window.
